The main goal of the project was to visualize population distribution using datasets from the World Bank. Population data for various countries over several years was loaded and inspected to ensure correct data structures. Relevant columns were verified, and population data for the year 2020 was filtered for visualization. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, a histogram was created to show population distribution across different countries. Additionally, a bar chart depicting population distribution by region was generated by merging population data with country metadata. These visualizations provide insights into global population patterns, aiding demographic analysis and policy-making.
